# Graph Algorithms (Java)


## General info
This project contains five different algorithms seperated into three categories: 
  1. Finding the shortest path from node a to b within a graph (Breadth First Search)
  2. Calculating the minimal spanning tree of a graph (Kruskal & Prim)
  3. calculating a eulerian path within a graph (Fleury & Hierholzer)

There are two ways to generate graphs to work with: create a graph from a file or generate random graphs of different sizes. For illustration purposes you can display any of those graphs.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* algs4.jar (algs4.cs.princeton.edu)
* Graphstream version: 2.0 (algo, core & ui jar files)
* JUnit version: 4.13.1

## Setup
In order to run this project, download the above mentioned libraries and add them to your project structure.
