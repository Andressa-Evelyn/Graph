# Graph Algorithms (Java)


## General info
This project contains five different algorithms seperated into three categories: finding the shortest path from node a to b within a graph (Breadth First Search), calculating the minimal spanning tree of a graph (Kruskal & Prim) and calculating a eulerian path of a graph (Fleury & Hierholzer).
There are two ways to generate graphs to work with: create a graph from a file (can be found in the resources directory) or generate random graphs of different sizes. For illustration you can display any graph.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* algs4.jar (algs4.cs.princeton.edu)
* Graphstream version: 2.0 (algo, core & ui jar files)
* JUnit version: 4.13.1

## Setup
In order to run this project, download the above mentioned libraries and add them to your project structure (IntelliJ)
